# LF Energy Architecture Model

The repos in this github org contains the LF Energy Architecture Model. 

# Introduction
The LF Energy members EPRI, RTE, Alliander, and Aachen University have joined together in LF Energy Archimate Working Group to create an architecture model for [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/).

[LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) is an open-source foundation focused on the power systems sector, hosted within The Linux Foundation. [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) provides a neutral, collaborative community to build the shared digital investments that will transform the world’s relationship to energy.

The goal of the LF Energy Architecture Model is to become the place to go for sharing references architectures and project architectures within the LF Energy community. It aims to clarify the ecosystem of LF Energy: wherefore can the LF Energy projects be used, how they interact together, and examples of how they can be adopted in reference architectures. This will provide a clear and deep understanding of how the  LF Energy projects contribute to business functions and help the project adoption, foster synergies between projects, and limit the overlap between projects.

For more information, please watch [the special episode of TFiR: State of Energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RO9GsljPUw) where Swapnil Bhartiya sits down with Prince Singh, Solution Architect at Alliander and Benoît Jeanson, Enterprise Architect at RTE, and talk about LF Energy Architecture Model and how it makes it easier for anybody in the world to identify LF Energy Projects that are of interest to them and how they can be integrated into their organization.

# View 
The model can be viewed [here without the need to install Archi](https://lfenergyarchitecturemodel.github.io/lfenergyfunctionalarchitecturemodel/).

# Edit  
To contribute to the LF Energy Archimate models you need [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/).

## Step-by-step guide for Archi
1. Download and install the archi software. This can be downloaded from the following location https://www.archimatetool.com/. 
1. Download the following Archi plugin "coArchi – Model Collaboration for Archi" (https://www.archimatetool.com/plugins/#coArchi) to share and version the created models. 
1. It is necessary to create a Personal Access Token. (https://github.com/archimatetool/archi-modelrepository-plugin/wiki/Refresh-and-Publish)
Creating a personal token is described in this link. https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line
1. Open Archi and via the menu option → Collaboration → Import Remote Model to Workplace
1. Fill in the archimate model l https://github.com/lfenergyarchitecturemodel/lfenergyfunctionalarchitecturemodel.git, your username and the personal access token.

6. The model is cloned from github and shown in archi. The following steps may still be required to get the model under 'Models': Collaboration → Toggle Collaboration Workspace: The Collaboration Workspace opens on the right side of the screen. The project is visible. Double click on the model: The model is added under 'Models' on the left side of the screen and can be edited.
